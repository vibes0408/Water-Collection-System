# Water-Collection-System
This work presents a novel, cost-effective approach for river water quality monitoring using a remotely controlled, depth-specific water sampling system. The system utilizes a valve and stepper motor combination to collect water samples at varying depths. The simple circuitry facilitates easy maintenance and accessibility. Future development includes incorporating an algorithm for automated depth selection and sample collection triggered by GPS location. Additionally, the system will be equipped with a GPS module for autonomous navigation and modular collection cylinders for adaptable sampling needs. This project has the potential to significantly improve water quality monitoring efficiency and reduce operational costs.
